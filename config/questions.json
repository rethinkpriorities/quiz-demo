      "info": "Some projects relieve suffering from non-lethal diseases or disabilities. We can measure the impact of these diseases in terms of how much worse one's quality of life is with the disability compared to full health. If we alleviate that disability, we can estimate how many years of health we are restoring.\n\nThis is measured by Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). Suppose living for a year with a particular serious disability means you lose 50% of your quality of life. If we relieve that disease for a year, that's saving ½ DALY. Estimates of how much a disease decreases quality of life typically come from the [Global Burden of Disease](https://www.healthdata.org/research-analysis/gbd). For example, GiveWell estimates that clubfoot has a disability weight of around 0.2. If we treat an infant and prevent them from suffering from 60 years of clubfoot, this intervention will save 12 DALYs. Severe multiple sclerosis is estimated to have a disability weight of 0.7. Preventing severe MS for 10 years would deliver 7 DALYs.\n\nSuppose that living with blindness reduces someone's quality of life by 25%. You could either choose to cure blindness in a group of people, restoring them to full health for some number of years. Or you could save a child's life, giving them 50 extra years to live. How many years of blindness would you need to relieve to make it as good as saving the one child's life?",
      "context": "A person suffering from a disease or disability has their quality of life reduced. We can measure this in terms of the Years of Life Lost to Disability (YLD). For example, if I live with a disease that reduces my quality of life by 25% for 4 years, that totals 1 Year Lost to Disability. If someone dies, we can measure their loss in terms of Years of Life Lost (YLL) due to death.",

For now, let's consider animals that most people believe are capable of suffering (such as pigs, dogs, or cows) and use chickens as a test case.\n\nThere are some conditions that decrease chickens' quality of life, which we can measure in terms of chicken Disability Adjusted Life Years. For example, suppose living in hurtful pain for a year reduces a chicken's quality of life by 25%. Therefore, if we improve a chicken's living conditions to relieve this suffering, this would result in a gain of 0.25 chicken DALYs. Likewise, some human conditions reduce a human's quality of life by 25%, so relieving this for a year would result in 0.25 human DALYs.\n\nHow much do you value chicken DALYs versus human DALYs? In other words, how much do you care about a quality of life reduction in chickens compared to a similar proportional quality of life reduction in humans? Note that there are two different reasons you might give chicken DALYs lower weight. Perhaps you think a 25% reduction in a chicken's quality of life involves less suffering (or loss of meaningful experiences) than a 25% reduction in a human's quality of life.
