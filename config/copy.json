    "content": "**This version is a prototype. The funds, underlying data, and calculations in this version are placeholders meant to illustrate the type of behavior you can expect from the tool. All of these will change in future versions.** \n\n **Donor Compass helps you find a distribution of donations across funds that fits your personal values.** The tool asks for your personal preferences about things that matter when assessing different charitable projects (like how much you weigh animal suffering or effects on the distant future) and then calculates which funds best match those preferences. Importantly, future versions will account for diminishing returns, so recommendations will update as large amounts of money go into specific funds.\n\n **What we're seeking feedback on:** The types of inputs and questions we ask, the general workflow and layout, and what changes would make this tool more useful for your decision making.\n\n **Future iterations will include:**\n- A usable version ready in early March 2026, including the GiveWell Top Charities Fund, EA Animal Welfare Fund, Longview Philanthropy Fund, and others\n- Detailed cost-effectiveness estimates for included funds\n- Detailed explanations of all calculations that account for diminishing returns\n- Different methods for aggregating your inputs into recommended allocations\n- A power user version that is more freely configurable \n- A fund, guided by the most recent research and funding insights, that distributes across cause areas  \n- Potentially: an LLM interface that helps you interpret the calculations and results.\n\n**Share your feedback:** Please share any thoughts, however brief, in [this form](https://rethinkpriorities.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9mJlFv7Tch8qMMC) or by email to {{EMAIL}}.
