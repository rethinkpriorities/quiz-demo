Others, like investments in education or infrastructure, could take years to arise. Other effects will arise in the longer run future. When you are evaluating projects, do you give extra weight to effects that will happen sooner (in the next decade) rather than later (decades or even centuries in the future)?\n\nThere are several reasons why you might give extra weight to near-term effects. First, you might think it's more morally important to help individuals that currently exist or will exist very soon than it is to help individuals that will potentially exist in the future. Alternatively, even if you think all beings matter equally, regardless of time, you might be so uncertain about a project's long-term effects that you'd rather focus on the more predictable near future.",
